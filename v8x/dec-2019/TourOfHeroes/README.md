This project addresses the following best practices:

- A recommended folder structure based on [Dave Bush's 'Angular Architectural Best Practices'](https://github.com/DaveMBush/davembush.github.io/blob/source/source/_posts/An-Angular-Application-Architecture-That-Works.md)
- NgRx store slice features and modules level factorization
- NgRx store driven reactive forms (eg login-form & login-form/slice)
- NgRx store driven app level 'loading' state and 'spinner'
- Various interceptors such as server-error & authentication
- Angular error handler ('handleError') overide for broad error handling (ie: logging)
- ErrorEvent and HttpErrorResponse simulation buttons
- Simple examples of Angular Material components
-  ++++++++++++++++
- Module lazy loading
